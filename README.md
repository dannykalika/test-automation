# test-automation

This project is to showcase examples of automated software testing.
I will aim to include GitHub workflows for each set of tests so you may view
the test execution and results in the `Actions` tab of this repository.
In this project I am not aiming for "full" test coverage of the public testing services
but rather to show how these pieces of software can be tested and how to do so (using NodeJS).
I will also be following and enforcing the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)
standard as I find that to be good practice.

Further details on tests can be found here:

- [UI Tests](./tests/ui/README.md)
- [API Tests](./tests/api/README.md)
- [Accessibility Tests](./tests/accessibility/README.md)

I will include some visual and web performance test examples
as I find public resources to use.

Thanks for reviewing my project! I hope that you have learned something,
and I greatly appreciate any tips or feedback!
