# test-automation

This project is to showcase examples of automated software testing.
I will aim to include GitHub workflows for each set of tests so you may view
the test execution and results in the `Actions` tab of this repository.
In this project I am not aiming for "full" test coverage of the public testing services
but rather to show how these pieces of software can be tested and how to do so (using NodeJS).
I will also be following and enforcing the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)
standard as I find this to be a good practice.

Further details on the UI tests can be found [here](./tests/ui/README.md).

Further details on the API tests can be found [here](./tests/api/README.md).

I will include some load, accessibility, visual and web performance tests
as I find public resources to use.

Thanks for reviewing my project! I hope that you have learned something
and I will greatly appreciate any tips or feedback!
